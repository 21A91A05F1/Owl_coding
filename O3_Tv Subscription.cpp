A new TV streaming service was recently started in T-land called the Hub-TV.

A group of N friends in T-land want to buy Hub-TV subscriptions. We know that 6 people can share one Hub-TV subscription. Also, the cost of one Hub-TV subscription is X rupees. Determine the minimum total cost that the group of N friends will incur so that everyone in the group is able to use Hub-TV. 

Input Format :
The first line contains a single integer T the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers N and X â€” the size of the group of friends and the cost of one subscription. 

Output Format :
For each test case, output the minimum total cost that the group will incur so that everyone in the group is able to use Hub-TV.
